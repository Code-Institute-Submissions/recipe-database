# Recipe Database

This is a recipe database that users can search using a range of search terms. They can also add their own recipes and edit recieps.
 
## UX
 
Please [click here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sBT4_3UXoEjqRvrDu9hr3lfJOWcQb9BYC8f4kiqR5iw/edit?usp=sharing) to see the database structure.

### User Stories

As a user, I want to:
- **Easily add my own recipes.**
The site has a recipe input form which is intuitive and easy to use. Users can type recipes into it, or copy and paste them from elsewhere. 
The templates are set up to format the recipes neatly once they are input.

- **Search for recipes according to a wide range of criteria.**

- **Edit recipes.**

- **See how popular recipes are with other users.**




## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Recipe input form in add_recipe.html enables users to add their own recipes to the database and display them on the site.

### Features Left to Implement

## Technologies Used

- **[HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)** was used to write the content of the site.
- **[CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)** was used to style the content.
- **[Materialize](https://materializecss.com//)** was used to make it easier to style the content and make the site responsive.
- **[Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)** was used to create routes and render the HTML templates.
- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** was used to write the site logic.
- **[unittest](https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)** was used for automated testing of the Python code.
- **[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)** was used to deploy the project.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
